# Package Template for the cloudyr project #

**PACKAGENAME** is a package for something...

To use the package, you will need an AWS account and enter your credentials into R. Your keypair can be generated on the [IAM Management Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?#security_credential) under the heading *Access Keys*. Note that you only have access to your secret key once. After it is generated, you need to save it in a secure location. New keypairs can be generated at any time if yours has been lost, stolen, or forgotten. 

By default, all **cloudyr** packages look for the access key ID and secret access key in environment variables. You can also use this to specify a default region. For example:

```R
Sys.setenv("AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID" = "mykey",
           "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY" = "mysecretkey",
           "AWS_DEFAULT_REGION" = "us-east-1")
```

These can alternatively be set on the command line or via an `Renviron.site` or `.Renviron` file ([see here for instructions](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/httr/vignettes/api-packages.html)).

This package is not yet on CRAN. To install the latest development version you can install from the cloudyr drat repository:

```R
# latest stable version
install.packages("PACKAGENAME", repos = c(getOption("repos"), "http://cloudyr.github.io/drat"))
```

Or, to pull a potentially unstable version directly from GitHub:

```R

    install.packages("ghit")
}
ghit::install_github("cloudyr/PACKAGENAME")
```
